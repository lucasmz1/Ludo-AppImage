<br>This is just an app repacked<br/>
<br>this emulator is pretty much like retroarch and some cores need bios here's the link where you can find it https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/Emulator_files go to this page and download from "multi-system" retro arch bios files, then extract the systrem folder in somewhere in your os and finally point the system folder from the configuration inside of Ludo<br/>
